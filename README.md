# Wheel_combinations

Different Types of wheel combinations are used for building Mobile Robots to
providing Different degrees of freedom, Support, etc..

## Cylindrical wheels

These are normal circular wheels of a particular wheel base and diameter.</br>
These wheels are capable to roll only on its periphery. Lateral roll is not possible.</br>
while rolling slippage over the periphery is zero. </br>
Manufacturing cost is very less because of its simple geometry.</br>

Omni wheels

wheels having rollers over the periphery with its axis at an angle of 90 degrees to the base wheel axis.</br>
Roll in two directions is possible, one along the base wheel periphery and second along the rollers.</br>
Slippage is there when these wheels are in motion. </br>
These wheels work on slippage.</br>
Manufacturing of these wheels is an expensive affair.</br>
Typically 3 or more wheels are mounted over the chassis for multi directional motion.</br>
The orientation of mounting of these wheels is in the form of a polygon.</br>
